Coding Challenge #1

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:

BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.

function checkMarkHigherBMI(markWeight, markHeight, johnWeight, johnHeight) {
  const markBMI = markWeight / Math.pow(markHeight, 2);
  const johnBMI = johnWeight / Math.pow(johnHeight, 2);

  if (markBMI > johnBMI) {
    return "Mark has a higher BMI than John";
  } else {
    return "Mark has a lower BMI than John";
  }
}

console.log(checkMarkHigherBMI(78, 1.69, 92, 1.95));
console.log(checkMarkHigherBMI(95, 1.88, 85, 1.76));
